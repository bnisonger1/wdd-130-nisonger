        Welcome! I became a counselor because I am passionate about the idea
        that strong relationships build strong communities. It is my honor to
        work with clients to achieve their goals through person-centered,
        customized, and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. I grew up in a
        military family and love putting down roots in beautiful Alaska with my
        husband and three children.

        Education, Training, and Experience: I received my Master’s Degree of
        Science (MS) in Marriage and Family Therapy from Capella University in
        2020. I received board certification as a Nationally Certified Counselor
        (NCC) in 2021 and as a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) in
        2022. I have received post-graduate training in the Gottman Method for
        counseling couples, EMDR for processing trauma, multicultural
        counseling, grief, and telehealth. I have worked in the mental health
        field since 2017.
