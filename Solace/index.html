        Welcome! I became a counselor because I am passionate about the idea
        that strong relationships build strong communities. It is my honor to
        work with clients to achieve their goals through person-centered,
        customized, and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. I grew up in a
        military family and love putting down roots in beautiful Alaska with my
        husband and three children.

      <h2 class="homepageheader1">Education, Training, and Experience:</h2>
      <p>
        I received my Master’s Degree of Science (MS) in Marriage and Family
        Therapy from Capella University in 2020. I received board certification
        as a Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC) in 2021 and as a Licensed
        Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) in 2022. I have received
        post-graduate training in the Gottman Method for counseling couples,
        EMDR for processing trauma, multicultural counseling, grief, and
        telehealth. I have worked in the mental health field since 2017.
